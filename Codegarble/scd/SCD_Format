                          The SCD File Format


  Description
  -----------

  An SCD file contains a compact description of a boolean circuit or a boolean
  circuit topology (a description with gate types are unspecified). Circuits
  are modeled closely after Foundations of garbled circuits by Bellare, Hoang 
  and Roagaway, available from eprint.iacr.org. Here a circuit is a 6-tuple
  f= (n, m, q, A, B, G, O) where n,m, and q are integers representing 
  the number of inputs, outputs, and gates in the circuit. 
  
  The wires in the cirucit are numbered in increasing order starting with 
  the n input wires. The gates are also numbered in increasing order, with
  the output of the i-th gate going to wire i+n+1. The extra 1 comes from the
  fact that the n-th wire in the circuit is used as a dummy wire for making
  single-input gates look like two-input gates, explained below.
  
  We assume that all gates take two inputs. This is without loss of generality,
  since larger gates can be broken up into two-input gates, and unary gates get
  are provided with the dummy wire as the second input. The two arrays 
  A and B specify the two input wires for each gate, i.e. gate i takes 
  inputs from wires A[i] and B[i], and it holds that 
  A[i] < i + n + 1 and  B[i] < i + n + 1 for all i. 

  The G array specifies the types of the gates. Each element of G is an integer
  between 1 and 15, representing the sum of the entries of the truth table 
  of the gate. More specificially, the value is 
  b_11 * 8 + b_10 * 4 + b_01 * 2 + b_00, where b_ij  = f(i,j). For example,
  an AND gate, with b_11 = 1 and b_10 = b_01 = b_00 = 0, gets 8, and the 
  constant gate that always outputs 1 gets 15.
 
  In an SCD files, all these values are stored as 64 bit integers. This is 
  just for simplicity, and enabling writing and reading SCD files even if 
  MessagePack support is not available in the environment.


  An example
  -----------
  Consider a simple circuit implementing f(a_1,a_2,a_3) = (a_1 & a_2) | a_3. 
  There are three inputs, one output, two gates, and five logical wires. We 
  will add the extra dummy wire to make it six wires overall. An SCD 
  representation of this circuit could be as follows:
  (3, 1, 2, [1,4], [2,3], [8, 14], [5]), indicating that there are 3 inputs, 
  1 output, 2 gates, the first inputs to the gates are 1, 4, the second inputs
  are 2, 3, the gate types are 8 = 1000 = AND, and 14 = 1110 = OR, and the 
  output of the circuit is wire 5.


  A simple SCD reading/writing application
  -----------
  The accompanying scd.c contains reader and writer functions that demonstrate
  how to read and write SCD files. Compiling this file needs MessagePack,
  download from msgpack.org. Once MessagePack is installed, the file can be 
  compiled in GCC, with the -lmsgpack switch.
